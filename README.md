# ResumeOS
Easily bootstrap an OS project to fool HR departments and pad your resume.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/melonmanchan/ResumeOS
cd ResumeOS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Tested with Python 2.7.10 on Ubuntu 15.10. PIP package coming soon, whenever I'll get to it.

## Usage
Just install the required dependancies as specified above, and run

```sh
python resumeos.py --name 'My cool OS project' --output 'Best project ever!'
```

to bootstrap your very own totally unique OS, that prints the output message and halts.
